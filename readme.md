#### LTC1298 DRIVER
This device driver Template is meant for the 12bit Analog to Digital converter module.

>The Analog To digital converter is responsible for transforming physical parameters such as temperature, weight,pressure into numerical values that can be computed by the microcontroller or microprocessor

>The Library is written to be compactible with all PIC 18 and 16 series microcontroller boards.

>Library relies heavily on the SPI Advanced Library written by me.

This Library was tested on the cloudx microcontroller boards but can be adjusted to any other platform of your choice.
